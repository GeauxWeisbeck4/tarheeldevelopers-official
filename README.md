# TarHeelDevelopers.com - Home of Tar Heel Dev Studio

TarHeelDevelopers.com was built using the Astroship template and built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, amongst other technologies.

The decision to abandon the Deno Lume site came amidst the lack of creative progress made on a boring marketing site - it was much easier to pick up this template and add creative copy with my busy schedule.

### Pagespeed Score

One of the main reasons I liked this template so much was its high page speed score which is shown below:

## Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS is already configured in this repo, so you can start using it without any installation.
